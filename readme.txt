Welcome

notes
------------------------------------
-haven't got a good name for this program so I named it DotAndBrain
-This was made mostly from a tutorial


opening the files
------------------------------------
Highly recommend you download Processing to see the code
(it's java but with sketches and its very good)
https://processing.org/download/

or use the .exe; it's in the application.windows64 (or 32) folder


what actually is this
------------------------------------
The aim of this is to make the dots travel to the goal in the most direct path possible.

The AI learns using a genetic algorithm: the 'fittest' have the highest chance of being chosen for the next generation, with a small chance of mutations occuring too; over time the AI learns to reach the goal in the least amount of moves.
